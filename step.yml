title: React Native bundle
summary: Bundles your React Native app.
description: | 
  This Step bundles your React Native app for offline use by calling the `react-native bundle` command. 
  
  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Add the React Native bundle Step after the **Install React Native** Step in your Workflow. 
  1. In the **Bundle platform** input, select the platform for the bundler. 

     The options are: 
     - `android`
     - `ios`

  1. Make sure the **Entry file** input points to the root JS file of your project.
  1. (Optional) You can configure the Step further using the optional inputs, for example, you can disable warnings and minify the bundle using the **DEV flag** input. 
  1. Start/Schedule a Build. 

  ### Troubleshooting

  If your build fails with error message `react-native command not found`, make sure to include the **Install React Native** Step before the **React Native bundle** Step. 
  If you run in to any dependency issues, make sure to include either a **Run npm command** Step or a **Run yarn command** Step before the **React Native bundle** Step.
